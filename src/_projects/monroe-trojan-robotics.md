This is the website for my high school [FIRST Robotics](http://www.usfirst.org) team. It was the first major website
that I created, and it's the primary reason that I know PHP today. I also wrote the content management system backing.

The website itself is fairly simple. It loads content from a MySQL database and generated HTML files.
ScurvyCMS&mdash;named while my team was called "iPirates"&mdash; is a fully custom content management system that I
wrote to back the website. It included a built-in WYSIWYM HTML page editor, file management, site menu management, and
even a newsletter subscription system.

Since I have long since graduated from high school, this website is no longer maintained by me.
