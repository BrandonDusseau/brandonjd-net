This is the website for my high school [FIRST Robotics](http://www.usfirst.org)
team. It was the first major website that I created, and it's the primary reason
that I know PHP today. I also wrote the content management system backing.

The website itself is fairly simple. It loads content from a MySQL database and
generated HTML files. ScurvyCMS&mdash;named while my team was called
"iPirates"&mdash; is a fully custom content management system that I wrote to
back the website. It included a built-in WYSIWYM HTML page editor, file
management, site menu management, and even a newsletter subscription system.

I've since left the team, and the website is no longer around, except for the
mirror that I currently maintain for the purposes of this portfolio.
