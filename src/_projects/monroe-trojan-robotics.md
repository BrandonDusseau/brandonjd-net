This is the website for my high school [FIRST Robotics](http://www.usfirst.org) team. It was the first major website that I created, and it's the primary reason that I know PHP today. I also wrote the content management system backing it, ScurvyCMS.

Since I have long since graduated from high school, this website is no longer maintained by me.
