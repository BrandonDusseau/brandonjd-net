[FIRST Lego League](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/fll) (FLL) is a youth robotics program targeted at middle
school aged children. In the program, teams build and program Lego robots to complete tasks on an obstacle course.

My high school robotics team hosted one of these competitions annually for local teams. At the time, the team rankings
were displayed in an Excel spreadsheet, which was updated manually to reflect changes, which wasn't the most elegant
solution. The intent of this software was to read this Excel file and display the rankings cleanly and automatically.
It was also able to act as the event's official match timer and displayed which fields teams were assigned to for the
current match.

I had quite a bit of fun with this project, and through it I learned how to use threading and Microsoft Office Interop
with the .NET Framework. Unfortunately, my robotics team stopped holding the event before the software was completed,
though an incomplete version was used during our 2010 event.
