Each year, my old [FIRST Robotics team](http://www.monroetrojanrobotics.com/) holds an off-season competition called the Michigan Advanced Robotics Competition. MARCStats is an application designed to provide real-time statistics for teams at this event, including rankings, match scores, and team information. It includes a "television display" which can display rankings and match results in a format much like that of a television sports broadcast.

Given the rules for any arbitrary year's competition, MARCStats can calculate its own rankings at the end of each match, based on points awarded to teams during the match.
