My former FIRST Robotics team held an off-season competition called the Michigan
Advanced Robotics Competition (MARC). MARCStats is an application that I
designed to provide real-time statistics for teams at this event and their
supporters back home. These statistics included team rankings, match scores,
and team details. Volunteers at the event could also use the application to take
attendance of teams, show alerts to attendees, and input match data in
real-time.

MARCStats includes a "television display" which can display rankings and match
results in a "10-foot" style format, much like that of a television sports
broadcast. This was shown on displays around the event venue to allow attendees
to easily check the current state of the game.

Since game rules&mdash;including ranking calculation&mdash;change every year,
MARCStats was to be designed to be able to calculate match results and rankings
dynamically based on an arbitrary game configuration.

Eventually I realized that MARCStats could never exactly match the rankings
generated by the offical scoring system at the event, due to the use of
randomization, and the manually input match results were not always reliable.
In 2013, the project was scrapped.
