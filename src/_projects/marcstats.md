Each year, my old [FIRST Robotics team](http://www.monroetrojanrobotics.com/) holds an off-season competition called the
Michigan Advanced Robotics Competition. MARCStats is an application that I designed to provide real-time statistics for
teams at this event. These statistics included current team rankings, match scores, and information about those teams.
At the same time, the volunteers at the event could take attendance of teams, show alert messages, and input match
data in real-time.

It includes a "television display" which can display rankings and match results in a "10-foot" style format, much like
that of a television sports broadcast. This was shown on displays around the event venue to allow attendees to very
easily check the current state of the game.

Since game rules&mdash;including ranking calculation&mdash;change every year, MARCStats was to be designed to be able
to calculate match results and rankings dynamically based on an arbitrary configuration.

Eventually I realized that MARCStats could never fully match the rankings generated by the offical scoring system at the
event, because at a certain point they are randomized. On top of that, there were just not enough people volunteering
at the event to make data input reliable. Unfortunately, this led to the project being scrapped in 2013. In the five
years that I worked on it, I learned valuable web development skills, so it wasn't all bad!
