SchoolCheck is an application I wrote in high school which checked various media outlets for school district closures. The intent of the project was to prevent students from having to check multiple news websites and TV stations to see if the local school district was closed or delayed. The application also checks the weather and highlights conditions that may be favorable for a closure or delay, such as fog, snow, low visibility, and freezing temperatures.
