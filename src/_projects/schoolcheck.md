While I was in high school, I grew tired of checking multiple sources to check for school closures during the winter.
To solve the problem, I created a web application which aggregated closing data from all of the local media outlet
websites to display whether my school district was open, closed, or delayed.

Later, I added the functionality to display current weather conditions for the area. It would also highlight conditions
which were favorable for a closure or delay, such as fog, snow, low visibility, and extreme temperatures.

Since I am no longer in high school and have very few users left (if any), the application is no longer maintained.
