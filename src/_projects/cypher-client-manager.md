Cypher Client Manager was a utility designed to manage clients and accounts for businesses. It is able to track expenses associated with clients, alert employees when accounts reached certain balances, and generate reports.

I was brought on as a temporary software developer to refactor, optimize, and implement new features in the code. Unfortunately, the project was dropped after I completed my work.
