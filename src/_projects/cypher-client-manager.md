In 2012 I was asked by a classmate to assist with the development of a piece of software for a client. In particular
this involved refactoring and optimization of the software.

I happily took on the project, which was a utility was
designed to manage the relationship between lawyers and their clients. It primarily featured an interface to track
transactions and expenses incurred by the client so that the company could easily generate invoices. The application
interface was written in Visual Basic .NET and used a MySQL database as backing storage. While working on the project,
I introduced HTML invoice generation to make it easy for users to save and print the documents.

Unfortunately, the project was scrapped shortly after my work on it was completed.
