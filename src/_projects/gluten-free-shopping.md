In late 2011, I joined a team of five others to create a mobile app that could help people with gluten intolerance. The app is able to locate nearby restaurants with gluten-free menus, scan items at the grocery store to check gluten content, create a shopping list, and list which ingredients are known to contain gluten.

While I was involved with the project, I built the server-side API that aggregated data from our database and other databases for the app to use. I also wrote the algorithm that the app uses to determine how dangerous foods are, based on the warning level of each ingredient.
