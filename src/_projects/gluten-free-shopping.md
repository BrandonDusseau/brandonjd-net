In late 2011, I joined a team of five others to create a mobile app that could help people with gluten intolerance. The
app was able to locate nearby restaurants with gluten-free menus, scan food items to check gluten content, create a shopping list, and list ingredients which are known to cause problems for those with gluten intolerance.

While I was involved with the project, I built the server-side API that aggregated data from our database and other
databases. I also wrote the algorithm that the app used to determine how dangerous foods are, based on the warning
level of each ingredient.

I left the project in 2012 after my position on the team was made obsolete.
