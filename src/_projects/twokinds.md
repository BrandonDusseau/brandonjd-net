In 2010 I began working with the author of the Twokinds webcomic to make
improvements to the existing website. Shortly after, a publishing deal was made,
and the new publisher requested that the website be redesigned to make
advertisements more visible to the viewers.

I continued working with the author to build a new design, which was to the
publisher's liking. In addition to layout and CSS changes, I also made
improvements to the small amount existing PHP code and added new PHP code to
make the website more dynamic and more easily maintainable. A few years later,
the website design was revised to enable high resolution comic pages to be
displayed. I took the opportunity to update the CSS and markup to use better
practices.

In 2016/17, I revised the website again to use all HTML5 semantic tags and
further improved CSS. The PHP was replaced with a static website using Jekyll.
