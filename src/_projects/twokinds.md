In 2010 I was offered a project by the artist of the Twokinds webcomic to create a new version of the website to accompany a rebranding and a move to a new publisher.

For this project I chose to experiment with design and programming methods that I had not tried before. I modified aspects of the original website design to modernize and optimize the website. I've also implemented a caching mechanism to speed up page loads.
