HuskyRUN is a visual public address system created by my team in a university
course. It was designed to be displayed at the reception desks of our residence
halls, replacing manual distribution of PowerPoint presentations.

The application was able to convert a PowerPoint into a video file and
distribute the video to displays across the network. The display also included
a lower third intended to display weather, mail distribution status, and other
information. Further, the application was capable of displaying and speaking
emergency alerts sent by an administrator.

My responsibility on the project was to develop the display itself, while my
other team members worked on the control UI and Python server. I used Windows
Presentation Format and XAML to create the display. I also built the component
that interfaced with Microsoft PowerPoint to generate a video from a
presentation file.

At the end of the project term, only the video distribution and display and
alert capabilities were completed.
