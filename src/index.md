My name is Brandon Dusseau.

I am a professional Software Engineer, currently working as a frontend and backend web developer at
[Barracuda Networks](https://www.barracuda.com/). I specialize in web technologies at the moment, but I have a passion
for all things programming.

I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University in 2015. Despite only being
in the workforce for a short while, I have been tinkering with code since somewhere around 2006. I've
written a number of desktop and web applications, most of which you can find on my [portfolio page](/portfolio). PHP
has been my primary programming language for several years, but I also enjoy dabbling in .NET languages,
JavaScript, and C/C++, among others.

Besides programming, I enjoy several other hobbies including photography, computer repair, video production,
tinkering with electronics, and most recently biking. If you'd like to see my photography, you can visit my
