My name is Brandon Dusseau.

I am a professional Software Engineer, with an interest in a broad array of technologies.

I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University in 2015. Despite only being
in the workforce for a short while, I have been tinkering with code since somewhere around 2006. I've
written a number of desktop and web applications, most of which you can find on my [portfolio page](/portfolio). PHP
has been my primary programming language for several years, but I also enjoy dabbling in .NET languages,
JavaScript, and C/C++, among others.

Besides programming, I enjoy several other hobbies including photography, computer repair, video production,
tinkering with electronics, and most recently biking.
